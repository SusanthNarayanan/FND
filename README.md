# Hoax Detection using ML

## Introduction:

The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms such as Twitter has become a major concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. Detecting hoaxes and fake news early can prevent them from spreading, minimizing their potential damage. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to help identify and classify fake news with high accuracy.

## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based model that can accurately detect fake news on Twitter. The project will employ three different machine learning models, namely Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to train and test a dataset of tweets for hoax detection.

## Methodology:
The project will follow the following methodology:

*Data Collection:* Collect a dataset of tweets from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset), including both real and fake tweets, to train and test the models.

*Data Preprocessing:* Preprocess the collected data, including cleaning, text normalization, and feature extraction.

*Model Development:* Develop three different machine learning models using Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression algorithms to classify tweets as either hoax or real.

*Model Training and Evaluation:* Train and evaluate the performance of the developed models using a suitable evaluation metric, such as accuracy.

*Model Comparison:* Compare the performance of the three models to select the best-performing model for hoax detection.

## Expected Outcomes:

The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

1) Develop a machine learning-based model that can accurately detect hoaxes and fake news on Twitter.
2) Compare the performance of three different machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, for hoax detection on Twitter.
3) Generate a dataset of labeled tweets for future research on hoax detection using machine learning.

## Conclusion:
The proposed project will contribute to the growing body of research on the detection of fake news on social media platforms. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project will develop a model that can identify hoaxes and fake news with high accuracy, enabling early detection and prevention of the spread of such misinformation.
